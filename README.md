# What Do You Know 2012 Canvas Image Generation

This repo has slides and code from my 2012 talk at Web Direction's 'What Do You Know' night.

## Viewing the slides

Viewing the slides via a file: uri will cause a Security Exception (Tainted canvas) on one of the examples, you'll need to instead run them from a local server.

I've included a simple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) sever - you'll need to put a node or node.exe executable in the same directory, then run the .sh or .bat script.
